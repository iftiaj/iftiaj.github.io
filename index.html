        <p> Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. <br>
            Applications of virtual reality include entertainment, medical, training and so on.

Computers have shrunk in size from the size of a room to being able to fit into the palm of a hand. And it is not just about size; today's smartphones are much faster than computers from just a few years ago. We went from reading stories, to listening to them on the radio, to watching them on a TV screen. Technology is becoming more and more interactive as time goes on and we are now able to stimulate many senses and it is becoming harder to tell the difference between what is real, and what is not. You cannot tell if it is a real man speaking, or it is a recording. So, what is next you ask? Creating an environment that looks so real to the point of being indistinguishable from the real world. Introducing Virtual Reality (VR). VR's main idea is to replace our real world with a virtual computer-generated environment which can be a game, some environment you walk around in or a 360 video that plays and you can view it from all angles.

                    We talked a little about the history of VR, but what about now and the future? We all remember the movie “Ready Player One” which is about entering the world of video games and being actively participating in action. However, I feel the need to point few differences between Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). While VR can transport the user into a digital world, AR can do the opposite, it can bring the digital world into our real-world environment. Good examples of AR games are Pokémon Go. And VR games like Lone Echo.
                    The main reason why VR is more successful than AR in the Gaming industry, is that VR can be very immersive in a realistic environment.

                <p> Virtual reality is already being tested and introduced in various fields such as education, medical care, exhibitions, movies, games, and social network service. Virtual reality is also being gradually introduced in theme parks. Virtual reality is arousing great interest to managers who operate theme parks. . The recent application of VR technology to the theme park has given a great impetus to the evolution of the theme park. The theme park provides a safer, more comfortable, more realistic, and more spectacular welcome through VR. It aims to provide a deeper immersion and a more realistic presence than any other media in VR.

                    Who says you cannot see the world while you are at home? VR allows you to see places around the world while sitting on your couch. VR becoming a promising technology in Hospitality and tourism industry. The impact of covid-19 has allowed VR to open its wings and to help boost tourism. With the advancement of technology computers are now able to generate 3D virtual environments. These simulations can replicate any tourist locations or attractions reproduced as 3D interactive imagery.

                    Cinema halls constantly looking for new and innovative ways to attract customers, to provide best experience and VR is the new weapon to its arsenal. Although VR usually associate it with gaming, but VR also can play a huge role in the film world. The main notion behind making a movie is to allow the audience to immerse themselves into the story and the concept of VR movie theatre is the perfect solution.

                    VR can be more than just gaming, for example, going to concerts in VR, Popular artists around the world are beginning to recognize the potential of VR concerts, where you can create a stage that would cost millions to build in real life and do all sorts of creative stuff which will ultimately create a more enjoyable experience. Artists like Travis Scott as well as Marshmallow have partnered with Fortnite to create a massive VR concert that was unlike anything we have seen so far.

One of the earliest uses of virtual reality is flight training program at the Air Force (Flight Sim). Since not only is it much cheaper, but it was also safer for the pilots. There was no need to go and train on fighting other jets which would cost millions of dollars when you can do it virtually. Eventually, VR being used for other military and other crucial training such as medical, space and so on.
